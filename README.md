Promptlet is an AI prompt management system that uses templating and variable substitution to assemble prompts for use in AI tools. Promptlet provides a way to organize, reuse, and share prompts, and to generate dynamic prompts based on user input.

# Features
#### Prompt templating: 
Promptlet provides a way to create templates for prompts, which can then be used to generate specific prompts by substituting variables.
#### Variable substitution:
