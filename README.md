# Overview

Promptlet is an AI prompt management system that uses templating and variable substitution to assemble prompts for use in AI tools. Promptlet provides a way to organize, reuse, and share prompts, and to generate dynamic prompts based on user input.

# Features
#### Prompt templating: 
Promptlet provides a way to create templates for prompts, which can then be used to generate specific prompts by substituting variables.
#### Variable substitution: 
Promptlet supports variable substitution in prompts, using a variety of variable eliminator settings. This allows you to generate dynamic prompts that vary based on user input or other factors.
#### Composed Promptlets: 
Promptlet allows you to create Composed Promptlets, which are ordered collections of Promptlet Artifacts. Composed Promptlets can include header, footer, and body sections, and can be used to generate complex prompts.

Promptlet plans to all you to organize your prompts into folders and collections, and to share them with other users.

# Use cases
Promptlet can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

- Generating prompts for large language models (LLMs)
- Generating prompts for code generation tools
- Generating prompts for image generation tools
- Creating prompts for interactive AI applications
- Creating prompts for AI-powered chatbots

### How to use Promptlet
To use Promptlet, you first need to create a Composed Promptlet. This can be done by adding Promptlet Artifacts to a new Composed Promptlet. Promptlet Artifacts can be created by selecting from a variety of pre-defined templates, or by writing your own custom prompts.

Once you have created a Composed Promptlet, you can generate a prompt by clicking the "Generate Prompt" button. Promptlet will substitute any variables in the prompt template with the corresponding values, and will generate the final prompt.
